## 📋 Project Overview
- **Principle**: This project uses `MODs` to keep the farm running automatically — for example, auto sleeping, auto skipping cutscenes, skipping dialogs, etc.  
- **Notes**:  
  This repository collects various server hosting solutions, as well as related `MODs` for running and maintaining unattended servers.  
  Please **do not** open `issues` asking developers to adapt to specific management panels or containerization technologies — those needs are community-driven and out of scope for this repo.  
  We may support them in the future, but **not** in this repository.  
  If you already have a mature deployment solution, you can submit a `PR` to add your repo to this documentation.  
  The `issues` section here only accepts `MOD`-related `feature` requests.

---

## ✨ Features
- **SMAPI Supported**: Compatible with `SMAPI`, allowing you to add `MODs`. However, some `MODs` may have limited compatibility (e.g., may fail to skip cutscenes).
- **Active Development**: The community is constantly improving and developing new features.  
  Issues and PRs are welcome! Compared to other unattended `MOD` solutions, ours is **the most up-to-date and comprehensive**.

---

## 🌻 Quick Start
- Download the `MOD` package from the `Releases` page.  
- Install `Stardew Valley` and `SMAPI`.  
- Install the downloaded `MOD`.  
- Run `StardewModdingAPI`.  
- ~~Configure your network: use FRP, DDNS, or public IP as needed. The default game port is 24642 (UDP).~~

> ~~Dark Arts~~  
- Run without a GPU environment:

```
On Windows, use Mesa3D;
On Linux, use Xvfb.
A one-click startup package is available in our QQ groups (see below).
